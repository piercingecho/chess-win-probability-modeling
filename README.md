# chess-elo-analysis
Exploratory analysis of chess games. Tries to answer questions like "Can we predict someone's chess elo through the sequence of moves they make in a game" and "Can we create a win probability model based on two players' elo and the first n moves in a game?" Uses data from Kaggle, that was scraped from Lichess, to accomplish this.
